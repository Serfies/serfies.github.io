Imagine our IT department. We are not a huge company with an IT department of hundreds of people. Instead, we are a smaller, focused team of just over 30 people. We work hard, often wearing many different hats. We build things, fix things and always try to make our technology work better for the whole business. During our previous IT restructure, a new role was created for me that included enterprise architecture as a responsibility. I acknowledged that a good plan, an *Enterprise Architecture* (EA) framework, can help us align our technology with our business goals.

This is where a big question came up. I wanted to do EA well, but we had limited time and resources. So, the question I had to answer is, which EA framework should we pick? We've all heard about **TOGAF**, The Open Group Architecture Framework. Most every architecture PD contains the TOGAF certification as a requirement. Companies seem to want TOGAF, but is that what is implemented in their business in the end? But then, we also hear about the ideas from **Dr. Slava Kotusev**. His work talks about being practical and keeping things simple. He emphasises a pragmatic, artifact-focused and tailored approach. This creates a real dilemma for us. Do we choose the big, well-known, detailed framework, or the one that promises a more direct, less complicated path? This choice felt critical in my case, because I did not want to follow what other companies have implemented without understanding the impact of doing so in a small IT team.

So, I started to look closer at these two main approaches.

On one side, we have **Dr. Slava Kotusev's approach**. This is less like a rigid, step-by-step manual and more like a set of smart ideas based on *actual research* into what works. His thinking says we should focus on being *pragmatic* and *outcome-oriented*. For our small IT team, this means producing only a few key things, called *artifacts*, that give real, immediate value. We focus on simple diagrams showing how things are now, clear ideas for the future, and actionable plans. This is good because it means we don't get lost in too much documentation. It feels *simpler* and much easier to start with. The learning curve is lower and it helps us avoid unnecessary bureaucracy. Our efforts can directly connect to what the business needs.

But then, there is **TOGAF**. This framework is truly *comprehensive*. It offers a complete method, called the Architecture Development Method (ADM). For a huge company, a framework this comprehensive is a big strength. For us, a small IT department, it can feel *overwhelming*. Implementing TOGAF "by the book" needs a lot of time, specific people and even money for training. We simply did not have these dedicated resources. We worry it could lead to *over-engineering*, creating too many documents and processes that might not directly help us right away. The learning curve is very steep. While TOGAF says we can *tailor* it to our needs, deciding what to cut and what to keep is a big job in itself. It's like being given a huge box of tools and having to figure out which two or three tools we actually need for our small task.

In terms of differences, Kotusev's approach is about practical value and essential documents. TOGAF focuses on a full method and governance. Kotusev's way is *lower* in complexity and resource demand and it's more *adaptable*. TOGAF is higher in these areas and more *prescriptive*, even with tailoring. The amount of documents created can also be very different, with Kotusev suggesting a *minimal set* of high-impact documents, while TOGAF can lead to many. For a small IT team like ours, I feel the differences are very clear, one feels like a small, efficient vehicle and the other feels like a semi truck, which might be too much for the small road we have to navigatge.

So, what have we learned? For our small IT department, the insights from **Dr. Kotusev's research offered a more practical and achievable starting point for Enterprise Architecture.** His focus on minimalism, direct business value and only the most essential documents aligns perfectly with our limited resources and our need to be agile. It lets us deliver real results quickly and build trust with the business.

Trying to implement TOGAF in its entirety for a small IT team often feels unrealistic and can lead to frustration. If we do consider TOGAF, we would have had to *aggressively tailor* it. This means picking only a very small part of it, using its extensive content as a reference library and not trying to follow every step of its method. In fact, if we tailor TOGAF enough for a small team, what we end up with might start to look very much like the pragmatic, artifact-focused approach that Dr. Kotusev talks about.

Ultimately, the best EA framework for us, a small IT department, is the one we will *actually use*. It must provide clear value for our decisions and be something we can sustain with our current people and budget. It was clear to me that Dr. Kotusev's work giva us valuable guidance on what those practical, high-value elements typically are. In the pastt year and a half I have tailored an EA practice based on Dr. Kotusev's work and it has been a valuable guide to us, helping us avoid getting lost in complexity and instead focus on delivering real results.
