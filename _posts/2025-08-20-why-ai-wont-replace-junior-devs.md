![The Future of Software Careers in New Zealand, AI, Youth and Opportunity](/assets/img/2025-08-20-why-ai-wont-replace-junior-devs.jpg)

My son has been on the hunt for a junior software developer position and it has become painfully clear that despite growing emphasis on digital transformation, opportunities for early-career developers are increasingly scarce. This is not just a one-off story but it reflects a structural challenge affecting young New Zealanders entering IT.

The labour market paints a sobering picture. In the June quarter of 2025, New Zealand's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate ticked up to 5.2% ([Stats NZ](https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/labour-market-statistics-june-2025-quarter/)), its highest since 2020 and youth unemployment (for those aged 15-24 who are not in employment, education, or training) hovered around 12.9%. Regionally, some areas like Waikato and Northland report regional NEET rates exceeding 16% and 17% respectively. These figures highlight a growing barrier for young people trying to break into the workforce even as the IT industry continues to claim it needs talent.

A hard truth many leaders now voice is that AI can do much of the basic work juniors used to learn on, so some companies are trimming entry level hiring. [CIO.com](https://www.cio.com/article/3509174/ai-coding-assistants-wave-goodbye-to-junior-developers.html) reported in 2024 that several IT leaders say teams will hire fewer junior developers and interns as AI coding assistants take on boilerplate tasks. One executive even warns junior software developers will be the first to go, with seniors shifting to editing and supervising AI-generated code. A [2025 survey](https://leaddev.com/the-ai-impact-report-2025) of 880+ engineering leaders by LeadDev shows the same in that 54% expect fewer junior hires long term as AI tools mature. New Zealand commentary echoes this trend, with [The Spinoff](https://thespinoff.co.nz/the-bulletin/09-06-2025/ai-job-losses-are-coming-and-entry-level-workers-could-be-the-first-to-go) noting that entry level tech roles are already being squeezed as teams restructure around AI and no-code tools.

## Need for More, Not Fewer, Developers

In a recent interview that I have listened to, Matt Garman CEO of AWS, clearly holds a [highly optimistic view](https://youtu.be/nfocTxMzOP4?si=CetKU3S_T2R2Cmiu) regarding the impact of AI on white-collar jobs, including those in software development. He believes that AI will primarily **_increase efficiency, effectiveness, and enablement in work by taking away "toil"_**, which he defines as the mundane, repetitive tasks that people generally dislike. This shift, in his view, will free up human time for more creative aspects, driving value for companies and increasing job satisfaction. Garman emphasizes that AI will **_transform jobs, not replace them_**, asserting that companies and individuals who embrace and learn this technology will be better off.

Regarding junior programmers and software development roles, I’ve found Garman's perspective encouraging because he directly addresses concerns about reduced hiring and the potential obsolescence of new talent. Garman explicitly states, "_my view is **we're going to need more software developers not fewer software developers**_". He pushes back against the notion of reducing headcount even when employees become significantly more productive, arguing that a higher ROI from AI-enabled employees should lead to **more investment in those roles**.

## Junior Developers' Advantage

He strongly disagrees with the idea that companies should replace junior staff with AI. He points out that junior employees are often the **"_least expensive_"** and are **"_most leaned into your AI tools_"**, making them highly receptive to new technologies. He emphasizes the importance of continuing to **hire new graduates and teach them the "_right ways to go build software and decompose problems_"**.

Garman acknowledges that the job of a software developer will be "_a little bit different._" He suggests that while AI tools will become proficient at "authoring Java code" and similar tasks, humans will be needed for higher-level work such as **deconstructing problems**, **deciding what to build**, **pulling together and reviewing AI-generated code** and **coordinating multiple AI agents**.

I cannot stress this point enough. Our new generation entering the job market are more used to technology and AI that the older generation of experienced developers. These young people can bring fresh ways of thinking and novel creative ways of solving problems that will be more difficult for senior developers to achieve because they are already set in their ways of thinking, reasoning and working.

What should we do to assist young people who are looking to a career in software development?

## Cultivating Essential Skills

For students and new entrants, Garman advises focusing on skills like **critical reasoning, creativity and developing a "_learning mindset_"**. He argues that a specific technical skill might not be valuable in 30 years, but the ability to learn and think critically will be. He sees engineering education as valuable for teaching "_how to think and how to decompose problems_".

In line with my observation about junior developers being more adaptive and creative, Garman highlights that AI can **"_unlock that ability for creative people to go solve problems and develop interesting applications_"**. He also notes that advanced tools can **"_guide more junior developers as to like what are great coding practices_"**, helping them learn from seasoned engineers.

## Notes from Other Like Minded Leaders

There are other leaders who support and expand on Garman’s ideas, such as Aaron Levie, CEO of Box, who anticipates that a lot of future work will involve humans either **"_managing the agents or reviewing the output of agents._"** He states, "_it's our job to make the AI agent productive_" and he argues that AI frees up time for humans to do work "_we never got done before_" leading to "_capability expansion_" rather than headcount reduction.

Levie also introduces the concept of Jevons paradox in labor, suggesting that increased efficiency from AI could lead to a commensurate or even greater demand for services, thereby increasing the need for human labor. He provides examples in healthcare and small businesses, where AI-driven efficiency could lead to growth and more hiring.

Matan, CEO of Factory, emphasizes that as AI agents take on more coding tasks, the human role shifts to **"_systems thinking_"** which is the ability to understand how to break down large tasks into separable problems that AI agents can work on in parallel. He concurs that learning to code is still valuable, not for writing every line, but for developing this crucial systems thinking ability.

Mark Chen, Head of Research at OpenAI, suggests that while AI models will reduce the need for "_very detailed, very complex scaffolding,_" there will always be a need for humans to **"_tailor models to a particular application_"**.

Sean Grove, also from OpenAI, argues that in an AI-driven world, **effective communication and the ability to write clear specifications of intent become the "_new scarce skill,_"** making the person who masters this the "**_most valuable programmer_**".

## The Way Forward

Overall, Matt Garman, along with other leaders like Aaron Levie, Matan, and Mark Chen, presents a highly optimistic outlook. They agree that while the nature of software development and knowledge work will change, AI is fundamentally a tool for **_amplifying human capabilities and driving growth_**, rather than a direct replacement for jobs, especially for adaptable and creative junior talent.

It has been many years since I studied at university and I wonder how current tertiary education providers have adopted their programs to cater for an AI enabled IT workforce? I am especially interested in how institutions are teaching students creative thinking, critical reasoning, systems thinking and how AI collaboration can support them in their software development workflow.

I also believe companies with software engineering teams have a role to play in structuring graduate programs and junior developer positions to help young people who are interested in pursuing a career in software development. Below is a short list of actions companies can take:

* **Continue to hire new graduates**: Garman states that companies should hire young people fresh out of “_college_” and teach them the right ways to built software and decompose problems. He highlights that junior employees are “_the least expensive_” and “_most leaned into AI tools_” making them highly adaptable to new technologies.
* **Invest in enablement**: Rather than seeing increased productivity enabled by AI as a reason for headcount reduction, according to Garman, companies should see it as an opportunity to **“_invest even more heavily because the ROI on that dollar comes back 10-fold_”**.
* **Move beyond cost-cutting to value creation**: Levie states that AI should be used for capability expansion, doing more than ever before, rather than the reason for headcount reduction. Companies focused on doing more with AI will outperform those that only focus on cost cutting.
* **Value structured communication**: Grove highlights that the most valuable professional artifact is often “_structured communication_” (80-90% of value) rather than just code (10-20% of value). According to him companies should recognize that “_the person who communicates most effectively is the most valuable programmer_”.  
* **Understand AI as a role amplifier**: Levie notes that technology adoption takes time and that companies should realize early on that AI amplifies employee productivity and makes them more valuable. It is therefor important that companies implements change to such new ways of working which includes hiring new fresh creative minds to help with this change.

## The Hill to Climb

Although I am optimistic about AI, I am unsure if I can be equally optimistic about how well New Zealand companies will adopt AI and new ways of working especially in the realm of software development. From talking to various people, I hear that there are mostly SaaS companies in New Zealand that have embraced AI but in my opinion, those are only the tip of the iceberg. There are however many companies that still has a pessimistic view of adopting AI and some of these companies have software development teams who would be impacted by such a perspective.

I am hopeful that this will change. Companies adopting AI will soon outperform those that don’t and I hope this will act as a catalyst for the latter to also implement AI adoption.

I expect that it will take time for tertiary education providers and companies to mature in terms of preparing our young people for an AI amplified career in software development. In the meantime all I can do is advise young people to take the initiative to prepare themselves for the future. They should look for ways to become good at using AI to amplify their productivity, get good at creative reasoning and learn how to do systems thinking.
