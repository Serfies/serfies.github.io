![My AI Prompting Evolution](/assets/img/2025-07-13-exciting-evolution-of-programming.jpg)

I have recently listened to two very interesting interviews and an eye-opening presentation with three visionary leaders from OpenAI, Box and Factory. Even though these were three different events, their content overlapped on the topics of AI and programming. In this post I want to share what I have learnt and add some observations of my own.

## The Approaching Programming Revolution

Before I introduce the three visionaries, I should note that because of my coding background, I am very interested in the future of programming in this new AI age.

It is my view that the world of programming is approaching a revolution that will redefine the very essence of what it means to be a software developer. The rise of AI and autonomous agents is a present-day reality that is reshaping how we work, how we learn, the tools we use, our workflows and our roles. But unlike many other people who have a very pessimistic view of the impact of AI on jobs as we know them today, I believe that this is not a story of mass unemployment as people are replaced by AI.

I believe instead, as insights from these three visionary leaders reveal, what we are looking at is the evolution of how we work and in terms of programming, it is an evolution where value shifts from writing lines of code to orchestrating complex systems, communicating with precision and thinking at a higher level of abstraction.

## Sean Grove: The Future is "Structured Communication"

Sean Grove works on alignment reasoning at OpenAI and he stated in an AI Engineer World's Fair presentation that "*Structured communication is the bottleneck. Whoever communicates best becomes the most valuable programmer.*"

According to Sean, the code we write today is just the tip of the iceberg comprising only 10-20% of a programmer's actual value. He says that the programmer's real value lies in the other 80-90% of the work that the person does. He calls this "*Structured Communication*" that involves understanding user and business needs, brainstorming solutions, planning and testing. Below is Sean's full definition of **structured communication** from his presentation is:

* You **talk** with users to **understand** their challenges
* You **distill** these discussion and **ideate** concrete goals to alleviate those challenges
* You **plan** ways to build those goals
* You **share** those plans with colleagues
* You **translate** those plans into code
* You **test** and **verify** that the result matches your plans and achieves your original goals

Sean argues that as AI becomes more proficient at generating code the primary bottleneck will be our ability to communicate our above mentioned intentions and needs clearly to the AI.

With this in mind he explains that in the future "*specifications will be the new code.*" He is not talking about simple vibe coding prompts, but what he has in mind are durable, detailed artifacts that capture the full intent and values behind a project. Such a specification will serve a dual purpose, **aligning humans on a shared vision** and **aligning AI by providing it with training and evaluation material**. 

The most valuable programmer, therefore, will be the most effective communicator, a principle that extends to product managers and even lawmakers such as security and legal teams, who all, in a sense, program human systems with specifications.

## Aaron Levie: Our New Job is to Make AI Productive

Box CEO Aaron Levie, in an interview with Matthew Berman, foresees a fascinating inversion of our relationship with AI. He says it will become our job to make AI agents productive. A significant portion of our work will involve managing and reviewing the output of these agents. For software developers, this means shifting from writing code from scratch to reviewing AI-generated code, a change that could boost output by as much as 50%.

Like me, Aaron is optimistic about the impact AI will have on jobs. He suggests that the efficiency gains from AI will, in line with the [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox), increase the demand for services, leading to more hiring, not less. He explains that as AI handles the "*drudgery*", human talent will be freed up for more nuanced, high-value tasks like deep research and customer interaction. 

However, Aaron cautions that this transition will take several years, as it requires significant changes in how we work and think. For the foreseeable future, the ultimate responsibility for an AI's mistakes will remain firmly in human hands.

## Matan Grinberg: The Era of "Zero Code" and Systems Thinking

Matan Grinberg, the CEO of Factory, offers a bold prediction that software developers will eventually write "*zero percent of their code.*" I wonder how long it will take us to reach this stage?

Moving to zero code requires a fundamental mental shift from asking "*how can I get this done faster?*" to "*how can I break this large task into discrete, verifiable steps for agents to tackle in parallel?*" Matan explains that the human's primary role will evolve into that of a "*systems thinker,*" architecting complex solutions and defining the criteria for success. It strikes me that this aligns well with Sean Grove's perspective.

This does not mean that coding knowledge will become obsolete. On the contrary, Matan stresses that understanding the fundamentals of computer science will be more critical than ever for "*checking the work*" of AI agents. The incredible efficiency gains will allow us to tackle problems of a scale and complexity previously unimaginable, from niche business applications to grand challenges like space exploration. This will, in turn, raise the bar for software quality across the board.

## The Common Thread: A Higher Calling for Programmers

With individual perspectives from these leaders fresh in mind, I want to end with a couple of my thoughts.

I hope you will see an unifying view that the role of the programmer will not be disappearing soon. It will however evolve from **pure coding** to a role of **zero coding** and **structured communication**. I think the future of programming is less about the syntax of a specific language and more about the clarity of our thoughts, the precision of our communication and our ability to design and orchestrate complex systems.

To make this transition, programmers must learn how to be good at structured communication so they can **talk** with users to **understand** their challenges. **Distill** these discussions and **ideate** concrete goals to alleviate those challenges. **Plan** ways to to build those goals and **share** those plans with colleagues. Then **translate** those plans into code in the form of context engineering for AI to complete coding, and finally **test** and **verify** that the result matches the plans and achieves original goals

If you have read my previous post about my evolution in AI prompting, you will see how a zero code/structured communication role is one where a programmer will likewise evolve from code to context engineering. It will be the programmer's function to create the design, requirements, specifications, scope, standards, compliance of the system in an AI-optimised way so that AI can use that information to perform the necessary coding.

We are indeed living in very interesting times but I strongly believe that the coming programming evolution will substantially increase developer productivity and value. 

## The Challenge of Just Starting Out in Software Development

The transition from the current state to this future state will not be easy. For one, I believe that we already see that companies are not hiring junior developers because AI is making it possible for intermediate and senior developers to also perform the functions of a junior developer.

Anyone planning to start a career in software development must be smart and try and work around these limitations. Yes, it is still important for new developers to learn a programming language, programming standards and secure coding practices, but they should lean heavily into context engineering. It is important that they become good at structured communication because this will become an important and highly marketable skill soon.

**In closing**, I want to encourage you that by focusing on communication, context engineering and systems thinking, we can shape a future where technology empowers us to solve bigger and more meaningful problems.
