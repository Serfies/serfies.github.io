Let me tell you something I have been thinking about quite a lot lately. It is about how we learn and grow in our work, and how things are changing.

In the old days, and even now, the best way to expand your experience is often by learning from other, more experienced people. You find someone senior in your field, perhaps a mentor, and you learn from their wisdom. This works really well in a large organization. There are often many senior colleagues in the same or similar roles. You can ask them questions, see how they solve problems, and absorb their years of knowledge. It is a natural way to grow your skills.

However, this is not always how it goes. Many of us find ourselves working at smaller companies. Sometimes, you are the only person in your specific role. Or maybe, there just aren't more senior people around who can guide you. This creates a real challenge. Without those experienced individuals, it becomes harder to learn new things quickly or to tackle complex problems you have not met before. You want to grow, to improve your capabilities and understanding, but the traditional well of knowledge is not there. It can feel like you are on your own, trying to navigate difficult professional landscapes without a compass.

This is where I believe something truly interesting has emerged: Artificial Intelligence. We usually think of AI as a tool for doing work for writing, coding, or data analysis. But its power goes much further. With AI, these traditional limitations of not having a human expert are now removed. AI can act as a remarkably effective personal advisor, a kind of digital mentor. It has access to a vast ocean of information and can process it in ways that help you brainstorm ideas, explore different solutions, or understand new concepts deeply. Need advice on a specific project challenge? Ask the AI. Want to learn a new skill set related to your role? The AI can help you structure your learning and provide insights. It is a powerful resource that allows you to expand your knowledge and capabilities in ways that were simply not possible before, especially for those working in isolated roles.

This brings me to a moral question, one that many people are considering. Is it acceptable, or even right, to use AI not just as a "tool" to complete tasks, but as a "personal advisor" to help you accomplish tasks and grow in ways that would otherwise be impossible? Using AI to make your work better, faster that seems fine. But using it as a mentor, as a substitute for human guidance, feels different to some. Is it "cheating" to gain insights this way? Or is it simply a legitimate and necessary evolution of how we learn and develop our professional selves? For me, the answer leans towards the latter. When you are genuinely seeking to expand your understanding, to grow your skills, and to contribute more effectively in your role, then using AI as an advisor feels like a valid and empowering approach. It closes a significant gap, providing access to knowledge that might otherwise be out of reach. It is not about replacing human connection, but about enhancing your capacity to thrive, especially when traditional mentorship is simply not available.
