In my company, we have Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) functions. They are very important, of course and everyone agrees on that. But honestly, and this is not specific to where I work, but sometimes these functions operate like *different islands* in a company. Each Governance, Risk and Compliance team has its own goals, its own meetings and its own way of working. EA focuses on the big picture of our systems and processes, how they fit together and where we want them to go, but sometimes EA functions apart from GRC. GRC on the other hand, makes sure we follow the rules, manage potential dangers and keep everything in line with laws, risk apetite and company policies. They operate mostly as *distinct and separate functions*. We appreciate what both do, but they are not really woven together in a seamless way.

### The Unseen Gap: Why GRC Needs a Bigger Role

EA and GRC separation creates a *divide*. I think that when GRC is mostly an afterthought, it often steps in *after* critical decisions are made or solutions are already built. In this case I see GRC like a strict auditor who only arrives at the end of a project to point out problems, rather than a trusted advisor who helps shape things from the start. This can lead to inefficiencies, unexpected compliance issues and even significant risks emerging later down the line. We might design a great system, but if it doesn't meet critical regulatory requirements or introduces new vulnerabilities, then its true value is compromised. My goal is to see GRC take *center stage* in EA and through doing so, moving GRC beyond just being a separate check and becoming a core part of our strategic fabric.

### Weaving the Threads: GRC's Path Through EA Functions

But how do we make this happen? How can GRC truly integrate and become central to our EA efforts? [Dr. Slava Kotusev](https://kotusev.com/) talks about three main functions of EA: Strategy Planning, Technology Optimisation and Initiative Delivery. I believe GRC can and should be a *fundamental part* of each of these.

First, consider **Strategy Planning**. This is where we set our future direction and map out our target state architecture. When we plan our strategy, GRC should be *right there*. It helps us understand our *appetite for risk* before we even set our big goals. For example, a new strategic direction might open us to new kinds of cyber threats. GRC brings this perspective immediately. Compliance requirements, like data privacy laws are not just rules to follow later. They should *shape the very vision* of what we can achieve and how we should pursue it. GRC provides the necessary constraints and opportunities that guide our strategic choices from the outset.

Next, we have **Technology Optimisation**. This function is about making our existing IT landscape better, more efficient and often more modern. For optimizing technology, GRC brings *discipline* and *foresight*. It makes sure we are not just efficient, but also inherently *secure* and *compliant*. When we simplify our systems, GRC helps us identify legacy risks in the old ways and build robust controls into the new, optimized ones. It ensures that data classification, access management and security protocols are integrated into the design, not patched on afterward. We are making our technology *resilient* as well as streamlined.

Finally and crucially, comes **Initiative Delivery**. This is where projects and programs actually bring architectural changes to life. Here, GRC should be like a guiding hand from the *very beginning* of any initiative. It is not just a final checklist before launch. We should design security *into* the project from its earliest stages, considering data privacy and regulatory adherence *early* in the solution design process. This avoids costly reworks and fixes later. GRC helps embed proper governance gates and risk assessments at each phase of delivery, ensuring that every new solution aligns with our enterprise's overarching risk and compliance posture. It means building *assurance* into the DNA of every project.

### The Integrated Future: GRC at the Core

When GRC is truly integrated into these three core EA functions, it transforms from a separate checkpoint into a *fundamental part* of how we envision, build and manage our enterprise. It means that our strategy is inherently secure, our technology is optimized for both performance and compliance and our initiatives are delivered with integrated risk management. This holistic approach helps us not just *do things right* from a technical standpoint, but also *do the right things* from a governance, risk and compliance perspective from the start. The outcome is a more resilient, compliant and ultimately more *successful* enterprise.

In this post I have just scratched the surface of GRC within EA. I hope to provide a series of detailed posts about how to practically incorporate GRC within the three EA functions. Please visit my blog again soon.
