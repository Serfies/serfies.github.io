![My AI Prompting Evolution](/assets/img/2025-07-07-my-ai-prompting-evolution.png)

It was late 2022 when OpenAI made ChatGPT generally available. I remember it clearly. Suddenly, this powerful *artificial intelligence* was just there, ready for use. Many people were talking about how amazing it was. Initially I did not understand the fuss, but I was quick to jump in and start exploring for myself. My first thought was how I could use AI at my workplace. I wanted to see how it could make me *more effective*, *more efficient* and really *improve the quality of my work*. Back then, I just thought about simple things, about giving it a question or a command.

### The Problem Arises

While that initial *prompting* was useful, I soon found its limits. We all came face to face with the frequent and out of this world hallucinations but my challenge with early models was more about how I can get longer and more persistently accurate results. It felt like a bit of a *trial-and-error* process. I would type a question, get a reply, and then try another, hoping for better results. There was no real system to it. This became a *challenge* when I needed AI to help me with *long-form content* or serious *research*. The quality was not always consistent and I struggled to get the detailed, structured output I truly wanted. It was clear that just giving a one-off input was not enough.

### The Evolving Journey

As AI technology began to mature, the way I interacted with it also changed significantly. My understanding grew.

I discovered what people called **Prompt Engineering**. This happened around 2023. It was a big step up. Instead of just asking questions, I started *crafting* and *structuring* my prompts. I learned about using JSON prompt *templates*, embedding *examples* directly into my requests (called "few-shot prompting") and even guiding the AI through *reasoning steps* (like "chain-of-thought"). This deliberate design process truly transformed the quality of content the AI could help me create. It made a *profound difference* for things like *long-form articles* and getting *in-depth research summaries*. But even then, I sometimes felt confined, working within a single, static block of text.

Feeling that I have mastered prompting large language models for text generation and language assitance, with my background in software development, I started to explore a new idea: using AI as a *virtual software engineering assistant*. This was especially true when Andrej Karpathy talked about "vibe coding" in early 2025. It meant working in a fluid, almost *pair-programming* style with the AI. I would give it high-level goals and it would freely generate or modify code. Tools like *Cline* and *VSCode* became my key partners in this endeavor. It felt like giving the AI the general "vibe" of what I wanted and letting it build.

More recently, I found myself exploring something even more powerful: **Context Engineering**. This approach emerged around mid-2025 and it truly opened new doors. It's not just about one prompt but it's about *designing entire systems*. These systems automatically *assemble*, *format* and *feed all the relevant information and tools* into the AI model at exactly the right moment. The context becomes *dynamic*, built on the fly. This means the AI has precisely what it needs, whether it's pulling information from documents, databases, or using external tools through *API integrations*. It feels like giving the AI a complete, constantly updated understanding of the entire situation. I have found *Kilo Code* in *VSCode* to be a *fantastic context engineering tool* for this. I'm currently using it while building a complex, AI-enabled *Chrome extension* of my own. I just love how I can define coding standards, security standards, visual design guides and overall brief of what the new software is about to help AI stay withing these guardrails.

### The Resolution

This journey, from simple prompting to sophisticated context engineering, has been incredibly rewarding. Context engineering has enabled me to do so much more than I ever thought possible. I am now *far more effective* in building software. The AI behaves more reliably and it helps me create complex projects *seamlessly*, with fewer "hallucinations" or mistakes.

My exploration of AI is far from over. I am very keen to keep learning and continue exploring the amazing capabilities that these advanced methods, especially context engineering, bring to the table. The future of building with AI looks truly exciting.
