These days, it feels like everyone is talking about Artificial Intelligence, or AI. It comes in many forms, Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini etc. You hear about it in the news, in movies and even in everyday conversations. It is a new technology and like with many new things, there is a mix of excitement and also some worry. People are trying to understand what it means for our future and for our daily lives.

The biggest worry many people have is this: Is AI a threat to people? Specifically, a lot of concern centers on jobs. Will AI take away our work? Will it make human skills less important? This fear is very real for many, and it is a big question that needs to be explored with clear eyes.

To understand this, I like to think about something else that changed the world of work not so long ago - the shift from film photography to digital photography. Before, if you wanted to take a picture, you used a film camera. After, you had to take the film to a special place, like a lab, for developing and printing. You sometimes had to wait days or weeks for your film to be processed and printed before you knew if any of your photos were any good. People working in these labs were experts. They knew how to handle chemicals and darkrooms. When digital cameras came along, some of those jobs definitely changed or even disappeared. That is a tough truth of progress.

But think about what digital photography brought to the vast majority of people. It was a revolution. First, you could see your photo immediately on the camera screen. If you made a mistake, you knew right away and could fix it. No more wasted film or waiting days to find out your picture was blurry. Second, printing photos became much faster and easier. You could do it at home, or send files quickly to a shop. Third, taking pictures became so much cheaper. Instead of expensive rolls of film with only 24 or 36 shots, you could take thousands of photos on a small memory card and storage costs are incredibly low. Finally, digital cameras, especially with software, allowed anyone to manipulate photos. What once needed an expert in a darkroom, with very specialized skills, people can now do with a few taps on a phone app. We can brighten, crop, or even completely change a photo with ease.

Initially there were many people pushing back on the idea of "*digital*" film. How could anything digital be better than film. Yes, in the early days digital lagged behind film, but it soon caught up and simply becase the superior product and almost everyone made the switch to digital as a result.

In the same way, AI is like that powerful digital tool. It might change some jobs, yes, just as digital changed darkroom work. But it also offers a huge opportunity for us. AI can take away the "*menial tasks*". The repetitive, boring jobs that often drain our time and energy. With AI handling these duties, people are freed up to focus on more important, creative or complex work. We can expand our roles, think bigger and spend time on tasks that truly need human intelligence and connection. For businesses, this means employees can provide higher quality work at potentially lower costs, leading to better products and services. It is about working smarter, not necessarily harder.

So, when we look at AI, we should not just see a threat. We should see it as a powerful new tool, much like the digital camera was. It brings immense potential for advancement in how we work, learn and interact with the world. While there might be adjustments, the overall impact can be overwhelmingly positive, allowing us to achieve things that were once impossible. It is about evolving and embracing the benefits that these new technologies can bring to everyone.
